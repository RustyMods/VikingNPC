# Viking NPC

Inspired by blacks7ar [RenegadeVikings](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/blacks7ar/RenegadeVikings/) and other games that add companions. Viking NPC introduces viking settlers that can be tamed, viking raiders that will engage you in combat, viking elves that are passive aggressive, viking locations to raid, and viking raids that will raid you.

Expect to find gear and loot because of the new atrocities of wars between, you, settlers, raiders and elves !

Recommended to use a [Recyle_N_Reclaim](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Azumatt/Recycle_N_Reclaim/) to manage all the dropped gear.


Plugin is still in development, please be cautious of its use as locations are permanent.

For comments, feedback, please find a thread at [OdinPlus Discord](https://discord.com/channels/826573164371902465/1265059648189239407) in Mod Testing, under <b>Settlers</b>

## Roadmap
- Improve location generation
- Working on adding more locations
- Locations are built off blueprints to keep the plugin lightweight
- If you have blueprints you would like to share, please find me OdinPlus Discord

## Settlers : VikingSettler
- Manage their inventory
- Equip them with better gear
- Requires ammo to use bows/crossbows
- Requires eitr food to use staves
- Will lumber, mine, repair and fish if given the right tools
- Will attach to ships and chairs if following
- Will attach to rideable tames, and make those tames follow player

In a world where raiders are coming to get you, manage your settlers to help you defend your base and gather resources!

## Raiders : VikingRaider
- Configurable Loot by biome
- Configurable Equipment by biome
- Expect to be challenged by these raiders

## Elves : VikingElf
- Passive Aggressive non-tameable
- Shares loot and equipment table with raiders
- Will serve as protectors and saviors if left alone

## Raider Ships: RaiderShip
- Passive Aggressive raiding ships full of loot
- VikingSailors variant that goes with raider ships - will die if not attached to ship
- VikingSailors do not drop loot
- Loot is based off global keys, the more keys, the more loot
- Config to change the speed at which sailors can harpoon and drag players towards them

## Player Ships
- Config to allow for at sea repair, without needing crafting station
- Config to change material needed and cost

## Locations
- Randomly generated locations all around the biomes

If you wish to test these out, the prefabName to spawn the location is:

- BlueprintLocation

Upon location spawn, the plugin will generate all the required game objects to create the location if the zone is ready. Expect a small lagspike as this happens. These are all based off objects already found in game, and is like a player built it themselves, so if you remove the plugin, the location will stay.
Albeit without some terrain modifications.

## Raids
- Raiders will randomly raid you wherever you are in the world. Be careful!
- Raider Ships will raid at sea

## Configurations
Recommended to try this work-in-progress mod locally before setting up on a server so you can properly configure it to your needs. Generated locations will be generated forever once loaded.
- Because these are based off player objects, you can even use modded equipment on them.
- You can find the Loot/Gear table at: BepinEx/config/VikingNPC
