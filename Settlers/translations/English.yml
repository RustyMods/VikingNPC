npc_settler_random_talk_1: 'Hail, traveler! Did you bring ale or just stories?'
npc_settler_random_talk_2: 'The mist of the fjords cloaks us like a shroud... or maybe it is just the smell of troll sweat.'

npc_settler_in_base_talk_6: 'What business have you within these walls? Looking for trouble or just lost your way to the outhouse?'

npc_attach_ship_say_1: "Hold on tight, we're about to find out if I have sea legs or just a strong grip!"
npc_attach_ship_say_2: "If we end up as serpent bait, I'll hunt you from Nilfheim to Asgard!"
npc_attach_ship_say_3: "Hold fast, like Thor gripping Mjölnir in a storm!"
npc_attach_ship_say_4: "If we meet sea monsters, I hope your battle cries are louder than your screams!"
npc_attach_ship_say_5: "May Odin guide us through the waves, or at least send a friendly seagull as a sign!"
npc_attach_ship_say_6: "If we reach distant shores, I'll carve our saga on the nearest rune stone... or at least draw a stick figure of us sailing!"
npc_attach_ship_say_7: "By Freyja's cats, let's hope this ship doesn't leak like a mead barrel with a hole!"
npc_attach_ship_say_8: "If we plunder riches, I call dibs on the shiniest loot... or at least a shiny seashell!"

npc_settler_shiptalk_4: "Loki's mischief! I do not feel so good... maybe I shouldn't have eaten that questionable fish stew."
npc_settler_shiptalk_5: "By the mead-soaked halls of Valhalla, I feel like a beached serpent!"
npc_settler_shiptalk_6: "Skál! To the joys of seafaring and the perils of seasickness!"
npc_settler_shiptalk_7: "May Freyja's grace guide us through these treacherous waters... or at least keep the sea monsters at bay!"
